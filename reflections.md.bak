# Reflections

Each of the following reflections gives insight into different aspects of my time at Iowa State University. The first one is a cumulative summary of my time, covering the most importiant lessons I have learned, and their applications. The second one is a short summary of my general education experiences, specifically delving into multicultural communications. Finally, the third one is a reflection on my views on ethics.
