**Tasks:**

During this internship I conducted thorough reviews of electrical and control system implementation specifications. Ensured that 
implementations adhered to risk management publications such as:

- NIST SP 800-53
- NIST SP 800-37
- UFC 4-010-06
- DoDI 8510.01
- DoDI 8500.01
	
I seamlessly coordinated content across various documents, including design specifications, design analysis, contract specifications, 
and federal cyber policies. This coordination ensured that projects fully met the policy standards set by the Army Corps of Engineers.

**Field Trip:**
From July 3 - 7 a co-intern and I went on a trip to Fort Leonard Wood Missouri where we toured the construction of the General 
Leonard Wood Army Community Hospital, and some of the surrounding IT infrastructure. This was an incerdible trip where I learned 
about the struggles and dynamics of implementing large scale, interdependant, multimodal controll systems in an environment with a 
large amount of stakeholders. A major element of this tour was when we entered the older United States Army Hospital at Fort Leonard Wood. 
Guided by the senior information systems security manager, he walked us through his the process of developing and security testing an 
isolated control systems board, which is a smaller version of a larger system, containing the network architechure and all major components 
identical to the larger system. I was guided throught the fire detection and supression system. Using a smaller system to verify and security 
test elements of a larger system allows for a reduced number of isolated tests before a system design can be verified.

**Knowledge gained:**

- Review of electrical and control system implementation specifications
- Coordinating content across various documents
