# <h1 class="centered-header">Welcome!</h1>

## Who am I?

My name is Austin Krekula, I was born in Fayetteville NC in 1997. I'm the first of 4 children. I am a soldier in the Iowa Army National Guard, its been a little over 6 years since I joined. I'm currently in pursuit of a bachelors degree in Cyber Security Engineering at ISU and hoping to soon start a Masters in the same.

## Passions
I really like reading, I love to read theology, poetry, fiction, I study other religions (Taoism is my favorite to study), philosophy,
and psychology, culture, history, and studying random things. My father, Nathan Krekula, was in the Army as well. Because of this I've
travled around most of the continental US. I really enjoy listening to all kinds of music, but I especially love jazz, swing, christian,
and French love songs. Some of my favorite activities are working out, going on walks, reading, studying random things, playing board games, and playing volleyball. I'm an engineer so i also love to find solutions to problems, so I always try to think of ways to solve problems for people.
I really love spending time with my friends and family. We do things like game nights, movie nights, and. I'm active in my church, I help
with sound and slides, I attend 2 bible studies a week, go to a Thursday night college student service, and attend church every Sunday. My
friends and I all eat lunch together every Sunday. But I like to spend at least an equal amount of time alone or with one or two other
people. I love to read about culture, theology, psychology, philosophy, history, and self help books. I also love good poetry and good 
fiction. I study other religions (Taoism is my favorite to study). I cook SUPER well. I work out 3 times a week, usually early in the
morning. I love going on walks.

### Hopes and Dreams

My biggest future dream is to be a father and have a family. My second biggest dream is to farm goats!

 I love playing games,
board games and sports. Volleyball üèê IS MY FAVORITE. I cook SUPER well. You'll love my food üòÅ. I listen to huge amounts of music of all
kinds! But i especially love jazz, swing, christian and French love songs. But i hate rap and ragaeton. I love deep conversations about
anything, I'm passionate about my relationships with people and with God. I really love talking to people and getting them to open up their
hearts. Sometimes that's pretty hard to do though. I am a soldier in the Iowa Army National Guard, its been a little over 5 years since I joined. 
I study Cyber Security Engineering at ISU. Moved away from my family on 2017 and I've been independent since then. My dad was in the Army
as well, so I don't really have a home state. I've moved around the US over 22 times, but I was born in Fayetteville NC. I'm the first of 4
children. I'm an engineer so i also love to find solutions to problems, so I always try to think of ways to solve problems for people.
Recently I've been thinking a lot about trust. One of my biggest dreams when I was a little boy was to be just like my dad. I think it's
changed a lot since then. But one thing that stayed with me forever was the dream to be a husband and a father. I've always wanted a
family of my own all my life. I want to love my wife and raise our kids well to follow Christ. I want to live my life in a way that honors
God, I believe that I owe everything to Jesus because of how he saved me, and I want my whole life to reflect that. I dream of being
virtuous, and righteous. I dream of being a man that can support everyone. Which is probably impossible... I want my life to be formed
around my relationships with people I love. I want to be able to help others see the truth of God, and help them open their heart to the
truth. I want to go back to raising animals someday. My seccond biggest dream is to raise goats! But i think what I want to do with my life
is try and help as many people as i can to come to know Jesus, because I believe that the only way to truly change the world is to change
people's hearts, and Jesus us the only one who can change people's hearts.
