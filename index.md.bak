# <h1 class="centered-header">Welcome!</h1>

## Who am I?

My name is Austin Krekula, I was born in Fayetteville NC in 1997. I'm the first of 4 children. I am a soldier in the Iowa Army National Guard, its been a little over 6 years since I joined. I'm currently in pursuit of a bachelors degree in Cyber Security Engineering at ISU and hoping to soon start a Masters in the same.

## Passions
I really like reading, I love to read theology, poetry, fiction, I study other religions (Taoism is my favorite to study), philosophy,
and psychology, culture, history, and studying random things. My father, Nathan Krekula, was in the Army as well. Because of this I've
travled around most of the continental US. I really enjoy listening to all kinds of music, but I especially love jazz, swing, christian,
and French love songs. Some of my favorite activities are working out, going on walks, reading, studying random things, playing board games, and playing volleyball. I'm an engineer so i also love to find solutions to problems, so I always try to think of ways to solve problems for people.
I really love spending time with my friends and family. We do things like game nights, movie nights, and. I'm active in my church, I help
with sound and slides, I attend 2 bible studies a week, go to a Thursday night college student service, and attend church every Sunday. My
friends and I all eat lunch together every Sunday. But I like to spend at least an equal amount of time alone or with one or two other
people. I love to read about culture, theology, psychology, philosophy, history, and self help books. I also love good poetry and good 
fiction. I study other religions (Taoism is my favorite to study). I cook SUPER well. I work out 3 times a week, usually early in the
morning. I love going on walks.

### Hopes and Dreams
