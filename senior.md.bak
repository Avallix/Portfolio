# Engineering Art: Urban Infrastructure Imorovement

##Problem Statement:
Generally, the public lacks some awareness of engineering problems, specifically the 14 Grand Challenges for Engineering, and their states of 
development. The understanding that the public has of the Grand Challenges (what they are and current state) influences their enthusiasm 
and engagement. If they do not understand the Challenges, then they will not have enthusiasm or engagement with their solutions. If they
 understand them then they will (more likely) have enthusiasm and engagement with their solutions. To address this issue, we aim to develop
 an interactive installation that appeals to people of all ages and effectively conveys Grand Challenges and their current states of 
 development. An enthused and engaged public is a source of funding, research (new minds) and application. If the public is more educated, then 
 Grand Challenges are more likely to be solved in a faster time. We will use an artistic demonstration to engage and educate the public in t
 he state of urban infrastructure development as a means to ensure they support the research and development of Grand Challenges.

##Project Description:
The Engineering Grand Challenge we selected is _Restore and Improve Urban Infrastructure_ proposed in the National Academy of Engineers' 
21st Century Challenges. This list of complex problems speaks to the future of engineering. Each of the challenges represents a problem 
that signifigantly stands in the way of the developmental progress of our world. The solution we have focused on is developing a tool drastically speed 
up the process of urban planning. 

Currently, we have decided on the following project:

A 3D urban development design tool that uses a touch-sensitive surface to detect and map physical blocks. Each block corresponds to 
different types of buildings or structures. When a user places a block on the touch-sensitive surface, a 3D representation of the building 
or structure appears in real-time on a display, allowing users to visualize and iterate on urban layouts quickly.

##Components:

Touch-sensitive Surface: 
This will be a specialized piece of hardware designed to sense the location and types of blocks, we plan on using technologies like 
capacitive or resistive touch panels.

Physical Blocks: 
Varied shapes, sizes, and possibly colors to represent different building types. These will be embedded with RFID or NFC tags or 
other markers to make them easily recognizable by the system.

Display and Processing Hardware: 
A screen to show the 3D rendered model of the urban design. This could be a large monitor, projector, or even AR/VR headsets for a 
more immersive experience. The hardware will be a processor component capable of taking input from the Touch-sensitive surface, processing the 
data, and outputting the data needed for our display to visualize it. 

Software Backend: 
This will process the input from the touch surface, translate block placements into 3D buildings, and render the urban 
layout on the display. It will also include features like saving designs, modifying building specifications, or simulating various 
scenarios (like traffic flow or pedestrian pathways).

##Potential Features:

Dynamic Scaling: 
Allow users to zoom in or out on the display to view the urban design from various scales.

Real-time Analytics: 
As blocks are placed, the software could provide instant feedback on factors like population density, green space ratio, energy load, or estimated 
traffic flow.

Different Modes: 
Switch between day and night views, or even seasonal views, to visualize how the urban space might look in different conditions. 

Scenario Simulations: 
Simulate scenarios such as traffic during rush hour, evacuation routes during emergencies, or sunlight distribution during different times of the day.

Save & Load Designs: 
Provide the option for users to save their designs and load them later for further editing or comparison.

##Challenges & Solutions:

This is an ongoing project, there hase not as of yet been any real prototyping, but some anticipated challenges are as follows.

Accuracy of Block Detection: 
Ensuring the touch surface accurately detects each block's position and orientation might be a challenge. Using high-resolution touch panels or integrating additional sensors might help.

Rendering Speed: 
The system should be able to render the 3D design in real-time as blocks are placed. Using efficient algorithms and possibly dedicated graphics hardware will be crucial.

User Interface: 
The software should be intuitive, with clear icons and a minimal learning curve. User testing and feedback will be vital.

Scalability: 
As urban designs grow complex, ensuring the system can handle large designs without lag or glitches will be crucial. This will require optimized software and possibly robust hardware components.

##My Role:
Up until now my contribution to our project has primarily been in planing, documentation, and brainstorming. Now as we move into the design 
and implementation phases I will be primarily contributing by advising on cybersecurity best pracitices and software and hardware security
reviewing. I will be coding, managing networks, setting up hardware, and assisting in development planning.

The knowledge I have gained has primarily been in the application of the design thinking and development process. We have only just entered 
the detailed phase of our design process,
