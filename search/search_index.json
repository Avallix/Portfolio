Austin has set up this guide especially for you to introduce you to the wonders of MkDocs. By the end of this guide, you'll have a basic understanding of setting up MkDocs and hosting the documentation on GitHub. What is MkDocs? MkDocs is a fast, simple, and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file. Static vs. Dynamic Sites: Static Sites : These are pre-rendered HTML files. They're fast, secure, and can be easily hosted on platforms like GitHub Pages. MkDocs generates static sites. Dynamic Sites : Unlike static sites, dynamic sites generate content in real-time. Think of platforms like WordPress. They can be more flexible but also require more resources. Setting Up MkDocs: Installation : Install MkDocs with Python by running: pip install mkdocs Start a New Project : Create a new directory for your project: mkdocs new [dir-name] Serve the Project Locally : Navigate to your project directory and run: mkdocs serve This will start a local server. You can view your documentation by opening a web browser and navigating to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ . Build the Documentation : Once you're ready, build the static files by running: mkdocs build Hosting on GitHub: Once you've set up and built your documentation, you can host it on GitHub Pages. Push your MkDocs project to a GitHub repository. Build the static site with: mkdocs build Deploy it to GitHub Pages with: mkdocs gh-deploy Your site will then be accessible at https://[username].github.io/[repository-name]/ . Remember, each time you make updates to your documentation, run mkdocs gh-deploy to see those changes online. Dive Deeper: mkdocs -h : To see a list of all available commands and their purpose. Explore themes, plugins, and extensions to enhance your documentation's appearance and functionality. I hope this guide provides a clear introduction to MkDocs and its capabilities, Uncle Moe. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarifications. Enjoy documenting!

Internal links between various pages ensure smooth transitions. This guide elucidates the process of creating and managing such links in MkDocs. Understanding the Directory Structure Your docs directory might resemble: docs/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 index.md \u251c\u2500\u2500 about.md \u251c\u2500\u2500 projects/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 project1.md \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 project2.md \u2514\u2500\u2500 contact.md This structure dictates how you'll establish links. Linking Methodology 1. Main Directory Links To reference pages in the primary directory: [About Us](about.md) 2. Links to Subdirectories To link to a page inside a subdirectory from the primary directory: [Project 1 Overview](projects/project1.md) 3. Subdirectory-to-Subdirectory From a page inside a subdirectory: Linking back to the primary directory: markdown [Return to Home](../index.md) Linking within the same subdirectory: markdown [See Project 2](project2.md) 4. Header Anchors Headers can also be anchor points. Given a header: ## Introduction Directly link to this section: [Navigate to Introduction](about.md#introduction) Verification: Test Your Links Post-creation, always preview: mkdocs serve Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser. Test every link to validate its functionality. Concluding Advice Maintain vigilance over internal links, especially when restructuring or altering pages. Functional links are the backbone of efficient documentation. After verification, always deploy your updated documentation, ensuring a seamless experience for all readers. For integration, save the content as linking_guide.md in your docs directory. Incorporate it into your mkdocs.yml under the nav section for it to appear in your documentation's navigation. ``` After you've added the page, you can include it in your mkdocs.yml file to ensure it's part of your site's navigation.
